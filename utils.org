* Some helpers

To run GA, we'll need some helpers.

#+begin_src lisp

(in-package genetic-algorithm)

#+end_src

** Getting a random value from a list

#+begin_src lisp

(def (function oi) random-elt (list)
  (let ((idx (random (length list))))
    (nth idx list)))

#+end_src

** Selecting a random Gen

This function is just a syntax sugar over ~random-elt~. It makes code more
semantic:

#+begin_src lisp

(def (function oi) select-gen (&rest gens)
  "Selects one random gen from multiple parents gens."
  (random-elt gens))

#+end_src

This function is used to select a random value for a gen.
~From~ and ~to~ values are taken from the gen definition. In case when gen
is an item from the list, ~to~ value can be nil.

** Working with lists

These two functions are used to process gen definition. We need them
because ~to~ argument is optional and may be followed by keyword
arguments. But ~destructuring-bind~ does not allow to use ~&optional~ and
~&key~ in the same lambda list

#+begin_src lisp

(def (function io) take-until-keyword (list)
  (loop for item in list
        while (not (keywordp item))
        collect item))

(def (function io) take-starting-from-keyword (list)
  (loop with collecting = nil
        for item in list
        when (and (keywordp item)
                  (not collecting))
          do (setf collecting t)
        when collecting
          collect item))

#+end_src
